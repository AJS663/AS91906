My Plan: I'm creating a web application which is a library system. This system can register, provide informaion, and allow users to loan books, without the need to spend time in the library manually looking for it and issuing it. It is easy to access across all devices without any platforms restrictions, and loaning books is convenient as long as the user has a registered account.

The Problem I'm Solving: Going through a library to look for a book can be inconvenient at times, especially if you have any physical problems or are wanting to loan multiples titles. the system fixes that by putting all the books into one organized database, where you get to easily identify what you want whether it's only one title or multiple titles.

The Main Goal: The main goal of this app is to help people with their experience of looking for, registering, and loaning books, making it a convenient proccess. They can identify books by their date of publication, author, or by a keyword, streamlining the libraries operations. It makes work easier for staff too, as they can track which books have been taken out, for how long, and how many times, helping them record more data. 

Who It's For: The app is designed for any demographic who are interested in literary resources, and who need convenience. The elderly or people with physical restrictions would benefit greatly as they can find what they're looking for without straining themselves.
